# Xgboost-Shelther-Animals

This is the code for a kaggle competition named "Saving Dogs and Cats - this competition involves predicting the classification of animals into an outcome (e.g. adopt/euthanize/other)"

The primary aim of this competition is to use a data-driven approach to identify dog and cat characteristics that contribute to adoption versus euthanasia versus other outcomes. Data were comprised of all the dogs and cats entering and exiting the Los Angeles  shelter in 2009-2013.

Tool used: R

Method: Xgboost
